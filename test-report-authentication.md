# Golf Reservation System - Authentication Test Report

## Test Execution Summary
- **Date**: 2025-09-06
- **Target URL**: http://localhost:3012
- **Test Account**: 01000000000 / admin
- **Test Tool**: Playwright with Stealth Plugin
- **Browser**: Chromium (non-headless)
- **Locale**: ko-KR (Korean)
- **Timezone**: Asia/Seoul

## Test Results

### Current Status: ‚ùå BLOCKED BY RUNTIME ERROR

The application is currently experiencing a runtime error that prevents access to the login page and all other functionality.

### Error Details

**Error Type**: Runtime Error
**Error Message**: `Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'`

**Stack Trace Location**:
- `.next\server\pages\_document.js`
- Node modules affected: `next\dist\server\require.js`
- Build system: Turbopack

### Screenshots Captured

1. **Initial Page Load** (`01-initial-page.png`)
   - Shows Next.js error page
   - Runtime error preventing application load
   - Turbopack compilation issue

2. **Dashboard Attempt** (`04-dashboard.png`)
   - Same error persists
   - Unable to reach login or dashboard

### Root Cause Analysis

The error appears to be related to:
1. **Turbopack Build Issues**: The Next.js Turbopack bundler is failing to generate required runtime chunks
2. **Multiple Dev Server Instances**: There are multiple dev servers running on different ports (3004-3012), which may be causing conflicts
3. **Build Cache Corruption**: The `.next` directory may have corrupted build artifacts

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Stop All Dev Servers**
   ```bash
   # Kill all Node.js processes
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   ```

2. **Clean Build Artifacts**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\pasia\projects\admin-golf
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```

3. **Reinstall Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Single Dev Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3012
   ```

5. **Alternative: Try Without Turbopack**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3012 --no-turbopack
   ```

### Test Automation Code

A Playwright test with stealth capabilities was successfully created and executed:
- File: `test-auth-flow.ts`
- Features:
  - Stealth plugin integration to avoid bot detection
  - Korean locale configuration
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Screenshot capture at each step
  - Automatic form filling for authentication

### Authentication Flow (Expected)

Once the runtime error is resolved, the expected flow is:
1. Navigate to application URL
2. Land on login page
3. Enter phone number: 01000000000
4. Enter password: admin
5. Click login button
6. Redirect to dashboard
7. Display user profile and quick menu based on permissions

### Test Evidence

- **Test Execution Log**: Shows successful Playwright execution but application error
- **Screenshots Directory**: `./screenshots/` containing error state captures
- **Test Script**: `test-auth-flow.ts` ready for re-execution once app is fixed

## Conclusion

The authentication test cannot be completed due to a critical runtime error in the Next.js application. The error prevents the application from loading entirely, blocking access to all features including the login page.

**Priority**: Fix the Turbopack runtime error before proceeding with authentication testing.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the build/runtime error
2. Ensure single dev server instance
3. Re-run authentication test
4. Verify login functionality with different user roles
5. Test session persistence and logout functionality
